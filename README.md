## Overview

### The challenge

This project was not as difficult as I thought it would be. I took the opportunity to make a good resolution for devices from: 900px to 660px wide and 659px to 375px wide.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Media Query
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I was able to have more control of the media query, this is good because I had difficulty understanding how it worked. I had a lot of use of Google's devtools, which was essential to integrate responsive design.
